QA Challenge Petstore

I have completed the QA challenge to the best of my abilities at this point. When I previously worked at Jumbo I was practiced in Automation but since going on maternity leave and being in a Manual Testing position (2yrs away from Jumbo), I have not been working in Automation. One of the reasons for me pursuing this role is that I am passionate about learning Automation again. I know given the chance I could re-skill very quickly again.

I have many skills to offer Jumbo including being highly motivated for the team to succeed, excellent communication with the developers and other QA's, the ability to understand acceptance criteria and test in accordance with these. Overall working towards shipping a quality working product.
