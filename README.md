QA Challenge Petstore

I have completed the QA challenge to the best of my abilities at this point. When I previously worked at Jumbo I was practiced in Automation but since going on maternity leave and now being in a Manual Testing position with 2yrs total away from Jumbo, I have not been working in the Automation space thus leaving a skill gap. One of the reasons for me pursuing this role is that I am passionate about learning Automation again. I know given the chance I could re-skill very quickly.

I have many other skills to offer Jumbo including being a highly motivated team player with an eye for quality, excellent communication with the developers and other QA's, the ability to understand acceptance criteria and test in accordance. Overall working towards shipping a quality working product.
